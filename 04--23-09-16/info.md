We have teamed up with Systime to bring you this out-of-the-ordinary meetup.

We expect to use the first hour and a half for presentations and the there will be mingling & networking.

Agenda:
- 16:00-16:10: Arrival. Welcome.
- 16:15-16:30: Briefly about Systime and the digital transformation / Kasper Ligaard, CTO
- 16:45-17:30: Testing TYPO3 using Codeception and SauceLabs / Mads LÃ¸nne Jensen, Senior Developer
- 17:30-20:00: Mingling and networking. Ask us about PSR-2, PSR-4 and PHP 7, as well as TYPO3 7 LTS - or anything else you feel like.

Softdrinks and beer will be provided by Systime at your leisure (within limits).

Note: Kaspers presentation will provide the reasoning of why Systime have used the past few months to upgrade the entire platform to be PSR-2 & PSR-4 compliant.
